The copy of FSharp.Core in this directory is version 2.0.50726.900, required by FSharp.SRGen.Build.Tasks.dll and other legacy Power Pack libraries in the parent directory.

This copy of FSharp.Core.dll should not be referenced as an LKG, it is present merely as a workaround to enable the legacy libraries to work without needing to update the GAC.
